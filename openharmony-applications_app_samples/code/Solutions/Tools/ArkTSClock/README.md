# Simple Clock

### Introduction

This sample exemplifies how to implement a simple clock application using the eTS UI capability.

### Usage

The UI uses **setInterval** to update the time at regular intervals and uses **Canvas** to draw the clock, where the rotation angles of the clock hands are obtained through calculation.

For example, **2 * Math.PI / 60 * second** indicates the rotation angle of the second hand.

### Constraints

1. This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

2. This sample demonstrates the stage model, which supports only API Version 10 Release.

3. The DevEco Studio version used in this sample must be (4.0 Release) or later.
